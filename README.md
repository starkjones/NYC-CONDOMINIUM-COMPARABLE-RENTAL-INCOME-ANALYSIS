A color coded map makes distinctions between areas clear and easy to interpret. The highest market values (represented by warming purple to yellow hues) are concentrated towards the center of the island between mid thirty streets and the mid sixties. Prices appear to decrease linearly as we move further north, away from Central Park's northern bound; Central Park North.
